Program Overview

The program allows users to input grades for different subjects or assignments, calculate the average grade, and display the overall grade along with additional information such as letter grade and GPA.

Key Features:

Student Profile: The program creates a student profile with a name and an empty grade book. Grade Input: Users can input grades for different subjects or assignments, which are stored in the student's grade book. Average Grade Calculation: The program calculates the average grade by summing up all the grades and dividing by the number of grades. Letter Grade and GPA Conversion: The program converts the average grade to a letter grade (A, B, C, D, or F) and a GPA (4.0, 3.0, 2.0, 1.0, or 0.0) based on the average grade. # CODTEC-Task2
